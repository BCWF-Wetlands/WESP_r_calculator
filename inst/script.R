#devtools::load_all()#, or in RStudio Ctrl+Shift+L to load the package

# install_github("BCWF-wetlands/wespr)

# - For ecosystem service calculation:
#     - filter questions list by used_by
#     - filter derived_values list by used_by
#     - subset and match weights from weights table
#     - ... magic
# - For multi-site, I think each question in the core_questions object can have
#   a list of values one for each site (rather than a questions object for each site)
